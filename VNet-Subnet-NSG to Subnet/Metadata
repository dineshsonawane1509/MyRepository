Key Implementation points:-
Key Implementation pointsARM templates must be used for provisioning Azure resources
Ansible & Powershell DSC must be used for configuration management. E.g creation of users, 
Provision VNET with 3 different Subnets
Each subnet must be associated with it’s own NSG
In Jump Subnet(SN) NSG, Allow RDP from Internet to jump servers
In AD SN, no internet should be allowed and all AD servers should only be in Private SN. Connection to AD servers should only be allowed via Jump servers.
Users connecting to jump servers/AD servers should only be able to connect using their domain credentials.
AD DS should be synced to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect.
‘Tools subnet’ is for deploying a 3rd party tool. Tool, assigned to you, must be installed into this subnet and must be made available using a custom domain.
